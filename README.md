ahk script that will orbwalk based on in game character and attack speed<br><br>

so what i want this to do:<br>
<del>open gui where you can select champion from a dropdown list</del> COMPLETE<br>
gui will also display current in-game attack speed from OCR<br>
when holding c, it will input "a" and "button 2" commands at very small random but precise intervals based on champion selected and atkspd<br>
closing out gui will terminate the script
