ahk script that will orbwalk based on in game character and attack speed

so what i want this to do:
open gui where you can select champion from a dropdown list
gui will display current in-game attack speed from OCR
when holding c, it will input "a" and "button 2" commands at very small random but precise intervals based on atkspd
closing out gui will terminate the script
